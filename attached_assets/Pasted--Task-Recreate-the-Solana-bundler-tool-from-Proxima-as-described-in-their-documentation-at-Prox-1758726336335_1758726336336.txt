**Task**: Recreate the Solana bundler tool from Proxima as described in their documentation at [Proxima Tools Documentation](https://docs.proxima.tools/).

**Requirements**:

1. **Front-End**:
   - Use React for the user interface.
   - Implement state management using Redux or Context API.
   - Create components for transaction input, bundling options, and result display.
   - Use Axios for making API calls to the back-end.

2. **Back-End**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Create routes for handling Solana transactions, bundling, and querying.
   - Implement middleware for request validation and error handling.
   - Use Solana Web3.js to interact with the Solana blockchain.

3. **Database**:
   - Use MongoDB for storing transaction data and bundling results.
   - Define a schema for transactions and bundling information.
   - Implement MongoDB queries to retrieve and update data.

4. **Functionality**:
   - Allow users to input Solana transactions.
   - Provide options for bundling transactions (e.g., number of transactions per bundle, priority).
   - Display the results of the bundling process, including transaction status and fees.
   - Implement error handling and user feedback for successful and failed operations.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for front-end components and back-end routes.
   - Create integration tests to ensure the front-end and back-end work together.
   - Implement end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Containerize the application using Docker.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
   - Deploy the application to a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document the code with comments and docstrings.
   - Create user documentation and developer guides.

**Deliverables**:
- A fully functional Solana bundler tool with a user-friendly interface.
- Source code for the front-end, back-end, and database schema.
- Test cases and deployment scripts.
- Comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
