# Overview

This is a Rust-based Solana bundler application that appears to be designed for handling Solana blockchain transactions and operations. The project is built using modern Rust async programming patterns with Tokio runtime and includes JSON serialization capabilities for blockchain data handling.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Runtime Architecture
- **Async Runtime**: Built on Tokio for handling asynchronous operations, essential for blockchain network communication and concurrent transaction processing
- **Memory Management**: Uses Rust's ownership system with additional smart pointer types (bytes crate) for efficient memory handling of blockchain data

## Data Serialization Layer
- **JSON Processing**: Implements serde/serde_json for serializing and deserializing blockchain transaction data and API responses
- **Type Safety**: Leverages Rust's strong type system with derive macros for automatic serialization implementations

## Concurrency and Threading
- **Multi-threaded Runtime**: Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler for handling multiple blockchain operations simultaneously
- **Synchronization**: Uses parking_lot for efficient mutex implementations, likely for protecting shared state during transaction bundling

## Network Communication
- **Socket Operations**: socket2 and mio crates provide low-level network primitives for blockchain node communication
- **Async I/O**: Non-blocking network operations for maintaining persistent connections to Solana RPC endpoints

## Development Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Standard Rust project structure with cargo build system
- **Error Handling**: Rust's Result type system for robust error propagation in blockchain operations
- **Memory Safety**: Zero-cost abstractions with compile-time guarantees, crucial for financial applications
